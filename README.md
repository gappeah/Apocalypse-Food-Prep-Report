## PowerBI Dashboard

The PowerBI dashboard provides several interactive visualizations to explore the dataset:

2. **Customer Insights**: Analyzes customer demographics and purchase behaviour.
3. **Product Performance**: Shows the performance of different products in terms of sales volume and revenue.
4. **Geographical Analysis**: Maps sales data and store performance by state regions.
